## Personal Writing Templates

This repository contains various templates that I use for **academic writing**
in $\LaTeX$ and `Markdown`. The `Markdown` templates are used for more
lightweight writing and are converted to `PDF` using [`pandoc`][pandoc]. See
the attached `README` files in each subdirectory for more information on how to
use the templates.
