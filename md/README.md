## `Markdown`-based Templates

The following directory contains a `Makefile` to convert the raw `Markdown`
files to `PDF` files. Type `make <NAME>` where `<NAME>` is the name of the
`Markdown` file without the extension. The `Makefile` options can be easily
modified to include additional `Pandoc` options.
